# 🐾 Pet Sitting SQL Database Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves designing and querying a relational SQL database for a **pet sitting service**. The goal is to create a normalised schema that stores detailed information about pets, their owners, and their bookings. 

This database is useful for tracking **pet characteristics**, **owner contact information**, and **booking history**—supporting analysis for operations and revenue insights.

## 📊 Key Features

- Normalised database schema with multiple tables and relationships
- Support for multiple pets per owner and multiple pets per booking
- Analysis-ready structure for generating booking and revenue insights
- Data validation logic included to maintain data integrity
- Use of `SELECT` queries to extract meaningful analytics

## 🗂️ Project Structure

## 📁 Folder/File Structure

- `create_database.sql` – Creation of the database.

- `create_tables.sql` – Creation of the tables within the database.

- `insert_data.sql` – Populating the tables.

- `select_basic_queries.sql` – Basic SQL queries.

- `select_advanced_queries.sql` – Advanced SQL queries.

## 🧠 Database Purpose

The pet sitting service requires a centralised system to:

- Store pet information (e.g., breed, size, name)
- Store owner information (e.g., phone, address)
- Track bookings (date, duration, pet(s) involved)
- Calculate revenue from past bookings
- Monitor upcoming and current reservations

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

- **Track active or past bookings** for a specific pet or owner
- **Calculate revenue** generated per week, month, or pet type
- **Find most popular pet types** or busiest booking periods
- **Cross-reference pets by breed, owner, or booking frequency**

## 📌 Business Assumptions

- Each pet is associated with only **one breed**. Mixed breeds are labelled as `'Mixed'`.
- The **price per hour** is fixed for each **booking type**.
- All bookings are **rounded up to the hour** (no partial hours).
- **End date is always later than start date**; validation logic ensures this.
- **Owner’s phone number does not change** (no re-verification needed).
- Owner address follows a **fixed format** defined by the system.
- A **pet has only one registered owner**.
- One **owner may have multiple pets** (handled via a junction table).
- A **booking can include multiple pets** (also handled via a junction table).
- **Pricing is not affected** by pet size or number of pets per booking.

| `vw_booking_dashboard` | A view to provide summarised booking information                         |
| `vw_owner_address`  | A view to extract and standardise owner address info                        |

## 📈 Sample Insights (from SQL queries) ???

- Total number of bookings in the past month
- Revenue generated by booking type
- Top 5 owners by number of pets
- Most frequently booked pet type

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL or MySQL compatible)
- Structured Query Language for schema, data manipulation, and analysis
- Organised using modular `.sql` files for maintainability
